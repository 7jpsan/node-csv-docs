## Development

Tests are executed with mocha. To install it, simple run `npm install`
followed by `npm test`. It will install mocha and its dependencies in your
project "node_modules" directory and run the test suite. The tests run
against the CoffeeScript source files.

To generate the JavaScript files, run `make build`.

The test suite is run online with [Travis][travis] against the versions 0.10
and 0.11 of Node.js.
